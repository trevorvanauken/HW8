<h1>Homework 8: Vector Spatial Analysis</h1>
<h2>Trevor VanAuken</h2>
<h3>In this map, I looked at the rivers in the Detroit area to see which areas had access. First, I used a buffer of 2 miles around each river.
    Then, I saw where this buffer intersected with the Detroit metropolitan area polygon. To make the metropolitain area, I had to dissolve the layer
    I downloaded because it was smaller units (cities).
